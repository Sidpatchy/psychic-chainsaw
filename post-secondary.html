		<p align="center">Computer programmers don't necessarily require any specific education after highschool. If a programmer is familiar with, and is able to demonstate this ability well enough to get certifications from that company, the programmer could easily go through their career without needing any formal eduation on the subject. This isn't the most common of things and it requires a lot of work and dedication before you can acheieve it. Besides this, most people still opt to go to school for it for the simple fact that it will help them more easily understand the functions and principals of computer science. It also gives people more of an incentive. The only degree worth going for, in my opion, in a Computer Science Major with a Math Minor. This however, can be very different for each person and often is.</p>
