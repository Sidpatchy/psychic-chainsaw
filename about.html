		<p align="center">A class I am required to take if I want to graduate highschool. The point of that, I don't really know, and your guess is as good as mine.</p>
		<h2 align="center">Important Information</h2>
		<p>This website was written from scratch by Ivan H. If you are interested in viewing the source code, you can find it in this <a href="https://github.com/sidpatchy/Psychic-Chainsaw">GitHub repository.</a> Additionally, this website is hosted using GitHub pages, directly from the previously mentioned repository, if you make a fork of it, it will generate a webpage using your account info instead of mine.</p>
		<p>Why am I using a sticky menu bar instead of a fixed menu bar? It's quite simple, you see, Edge doesn't display fixed menu bars correctly. Since Edge is the only browser we are afforded at my school, thanks to Microsoft's restrictive Windows 10 S, I have been forced to develop a website for the worst browser on the planet.</p>
