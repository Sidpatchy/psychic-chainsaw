		<h3 align="center">Projections for Minnesota</h3>
		<p align="center">In the United States, and Minnesota, the amount of openings for programming are declining, this isn't ideal, but as more and more jobs are shipped overseas and more here are able to be filled by graduates, this is an inevitable change.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Minnesota</dt>
			<dd>The outlook for Minnesota isn't great. Openings are dropping at a rate of roughly 10%/year however, close 400 openings still isn't discouraging, especially given the fact that there are 7,500 people employed as programmers in the state.</dd>
			<dt>The United States</dt>
			<dd>THe outlook isn't as bad, and still isn't very discouraging. There are 15,000 job openings in the US, with about 250,000 people being employed in this field. Some of which will still be filled or closed, at a rate of roughly 7%/year</dd>

		<h3>How much does a programmer earn?</h3>
		<p>Programming is a pretty big field with many different parts and even more companies, all of this on backbone of consolidation of the technology industry. As a result of this, many of the numbers given may not acurately represent how much you will make a s a programmer</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Minnesota</dt>
			<dd>A programmer in Minnesota, on average, makes anywhere from $60,000/year to $100,000/year and even beyond that. Not bad if you were to ask me.</dd>
			<dt>The United States</dt>
			<dd>A programmer in the United States, on average, makes slightly more than the average programmer in Minnesota ranging from $64,000/year to over $109,000/year</dd>
		</dl>
		<h3>Does a Programmer Make Enough?</h3>
		<p>Even though we already know the answer to this, I have to do this if I want to graduate. The short answer is yes, are you crazy? A career, with a median salary of $84,000 is more than enough for most people. If you want to live in Minneapolis, one of the most costly places to live in Minnesota, you can easily do so with somewhere around $20,000 left over at the end of the year, assuming you didn't spend it. Not only this, but this is with 10% being put in your savings yearly, along with a pretty generous alotment for spending on insurance, food, transportation, housing, and utility expenses.</p>
