# psychic-chainsaw
A project for career exploration, a pretty pointless class in my opinion.

The name? That came from the random name GitHub generated for the project. I couldn't be bothered come up with anything better.

I've had to do everything in this class 3 times so be ready for psychic-chainsaw electric boogaloo and psychic chainsaw electric boogaloo electric boogaloo.

Why on earth am I using a sticky menu bar instead of a fixed menu bar? Edge simply doesn't display them correctly. That's all we are afforded at my school thanks to Microsoft's restrictive Windows 10 S.
