		<h3 align="center">Why You Should Become a Programmer</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>Job Stability and Profitability</dt>
			<dd>Programmers enjoy one of the fastest growing and best paying fields in the world. There is such a need for programmers that companies semi-frequently get into "bidding wars" over one employee.</dd>
			<dt>You Typically Don't Have To Directly Deal with the Customer</dt>
			<dd>If you've ever worked in retail, you know pretty well how stupid some customers can be. In programming, you usually won't have to deal with the customer directly and can instead let some other dedicated department deal with them instead. Of course, you won't be able to avoid them entirely, you will still need to help fix problems they may have.</dd>
			<dt>Freedom (Relative to Other Careers)</dt>
			<dd>Because of the extreme need for programmers, people often have a lot of power in deciding what is included in their contract, often times, this can include getting to choose what times you work, where you work, and how often you work. Though, you do still need to pull your weight, otherwise you will probably not have this freedom for a very long time.</dt>
		</dl>
		<h3>Why I Will Enjoy Programming</h3>
		<dl>
			<dt>I Already Do It For Fun</dt>
			<dd>I don't know if you can tell, but I actually do this for fun, just have a look at my GitHub linked on the about page. I haven' been super active with public projects, mainly since these contain information about myself, and others close to me. I have over 5 active projects and 11 that sit in the background waiting to be picked up again.</dd>
			<dt>It Isn't Retail</dt>
			<dd>Retail sucks, if you need money, you tolerate it, but no one enjoys working as a low-level retail worker. They may tolerate it if they have friends there, and they may absolutely despise it. I am closer to the middle of the scale. If I could avoid dealing with the astounding number of Karens that I deal with every time I go to work, I would, in a heartbeat</dd>
			<dt>For Real Though, It Isn't Retail</dt>
			<dd>Retail is awful, anything that isn't retail is significantly better than retail.</dd>
